<h1>The Best Movies According to Simeon</h1>

<h2>My top 4 movies of all time. <em>(There are 2 thrid places)</em></h2>

<hr />

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
    <p>This is probably the most well knwon of Quentin Tarantinos movies. An absolute masterpiece of a movie!</p>

<h3>The Summit of the Gods</h3>
    <p>My all time favourite animated movie. It captures the so called "Call of the Mountain" like no other movie.</p>

<h3>The Good, The Bad, The Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West</h3>
    <p>When talking about western movies, these two are the most iconic. Two, dare I say, perfect movies!</p>
